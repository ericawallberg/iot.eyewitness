# IoT.EyeWitness


The IoT.EyeWitness framework proposes a solution for issues regarding the organization and presentation steps of the digital forensics procedures. 
Being made up of two main segments (data storage and displayment), the framework stores data given by the user in MySQL database tables and displays the same data in 
GUI widgets. The data storage step can be helpful when it comes to organizing artifacts as it concentrates information in one single database. The data visualization 
method simplifies the presentation process since the GUI components are user-friendly, human-readable information. Instead of simply displaying raw metadata, 
IoT.EyeWitness focuses on exhibiting graphs, plots and maps, using that information. For that reason, the data is consumed in a much more digestible way for everyone, 
with its target audience being crime investigators. In spite of the fact that the target audience is crime investigators, the framework can also be quite helpful in 
court settings, where people need easy, accessible information that is presented in a manner they can familiarize with.
